# LinkingConcepts
A very short python script that lets you come up ways to link two concepts.

Download, and either run:

(1)  python make_things_the_same.py
or
(2) python make_things_different.py

Example use case:

python make_things_the_same.py

type in a first item 
>  Ritesh Ragavender

type in a second item 

> tiny hippopotami

Ritesh Ragavender is same as tiny hippopotami
because.... 

> both of them are cute and adorable startup founders in Silicon Valley.

congratulations! Ritesh Ragavender is same as tiny hippopotami! 
(....because both of them are cute and adorable startup founders in Silicon Valley.)
